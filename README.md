# Cybersecurity Portfolio – Andres Portillo

Welcome to my cybersecurity portfolio. This repository reflects the practical experience and hands-on projects I completed as part of the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate Program**, combined with real-world applications from my work in automation, software engineering, and systems design.

## About Me

I’m a bilingual software engineer with a strong foundation in Python, C++, and SQL, currently expanding into the cybersecurity field through Google’s industry-recognized certification program. Throughout the program, I have gained experience in:

- **Security audits and risk assessment**
- **Linux system hardening**
- **SQL query security and injection prevention**
- **Incident response documentation**
- **Network structure and vulnerability analysis**

Outside the program, I’ve applied secure development principles in roles such as:
- **Automation Engineer at Crowe Guatemala**, where I built Python-based tools that handled sensitive financial data and reduced manual work by 90%
- **SwampLocks**, a predictive financial modeling tool that incorporates secure data pipelines and sentiment analysis
- **Service Hunter**, a full-stack service aggregation app using Supabase and SFML

I value creating secure, efficient, and ethical systems that protect both people and organizations.

## Portfolio Structure

This portfolio is organized by project, with each section documenting key skills and knowledge gained throughout the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and my independent work.
